To categorize user's audio aura I ran queries to average all three danceability,energy and valence

SELECT AVG(danceability) FROM songs; // 0.71646
SELECT AVG(energy) FROM songs; // 0.65906
SELECT AVG(valence) FROM songs; // 0.484443

It turns out that danceability has the highest score, energy second and valence
The user likes songs with high danceability and energy

I think that maybe we could assign some weights to these songs since they are ranked so user
listened to the songs at the top more to the ones at the bottom. That way they would be more representative
